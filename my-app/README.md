What i learnt:

1. interesting warning. image.png
   so i set keys to be equal to a numbering i wanted to output (at step for how it works, so key=01 and then i wanted step to be 01. got this warning). it seems that key is a special prop that cannot be destructured
   query:
   image.png - so at Modal.js, i exported navModal.
   However, at Navbar.js, i could import Modal instead of navModal. - image.png
   does the name not matter?
